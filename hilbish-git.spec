%description
Hilbish is a extensible shell (framework). It was made to be very customizable
via the Lua programming language. It aims to be easy to use for the casual
people but powerful for those who want to tinker more with their shell,
the thing used to interface with most of the system.

The motivation for choosing Lua was that its simpler and better to use
than old shell script. It's fine for basic interactive shell uses,
but that's the only place Hilbish has shell script; everything else is Lua
and aims to be infinitely configurable. If something isn't, open an issue!
