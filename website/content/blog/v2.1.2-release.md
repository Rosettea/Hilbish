> The release with full changelogs and prebuilt binaries can be
seen at the [v2.1.2](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/releases/tag/v2.1.2)
tag.

This release reverts the April Fool's code additions in v2.1.1. It is
functionally equal to v2.1.0. Nice!

A real release will come possibly in a few days or next week, so stay tuned for
the good and feature-filled release of v2.2!
