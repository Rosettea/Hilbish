	items = {
		'list item 1',
		['--command-flag-here'] = {'this does a thing', '--the-flag-alias'},
		['--styled-command-flag-here'] = {'this does a thing', '--the-flag-alias', display = lunacolors.blue '--styled-command-flag-here'}
	},
	type = 'list'
}
```

## [2.3.4] - 2024-12-28
### Fixed
- Skip over file and prevent panic if info cannot be retrieved during file completion (due to permission error or anything else)
- Apply environment variables properly after 2.3 shell interpreter changes
- hilbish.sink.readAll() function now reads data that doesn't end in a newline

## [2.3.3] - 2024-11-04
### Fixed
- Heredocs having issues

### Added
- Adding `\` at the end of input will add a newline and prompt for more input.

## [2.3.2] - 2024-07-30
### Fixed
- Command path searching due to 2.3 changes to the shell interpreter

## [2.3.1] - 2024-07-27
[hehe when you see it release](https://youtu.be/AaAF51Gwbxo?si=rhj2iYuQRkqDa693&t=64)

### Added
- `hilbish.opts.tips` was added to display random tips on start up.
Displayed tips can be modified via the `hilbish.tips` table.

### Fixed
- Fix a minor regression related to the cd command not working with relative paths
- Updated the motd for 2.3

## [2.3.0] - 2024-07-20
### Added
- `commander.registry` function to get all registered commanders.
- `fs.pipe` function to get a pair of connected files (a pipe).
- Added an alternative 2nd parameter to `hilbish.run`, which is `streams`.
`streams` is a table of input and output streams to run the command with.
It uses these 3 keys:
  - `input` as standard input for the command
  - `out` as standard output
  - `err` as standard error

Here is a minimal example of the new usage which allows users to now pipe commands
directly via Lua functions:
  
```lua
local fs = require 'fs'
local pr, pw = fs.pipe()
hilbish.run('ls -l', {
	stdout = pw,
	stderr = pw,
})

pw:close()

hilbish.run('wc -l', {
	stdin = pr
})
```

### Changed
- The `-S` flag will be set to Hilbish's absolute path
- Hilbish now builds on any Unix (if any dependencies also work, which should.)

### Fixed
- Fix ansi attributes causing issues with text when cut off in greenhouse
- Fix greenhouse appearing on terminal resize
- Fix crashes when history goes out of bounds when using history navigation
- `exec` command should return if no arg presented
- Commanders can now be cancelled by Ctrl-C and wont hang the shell anymore.
See [issue 198](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/issues/198).
- Shell interpreter can now preserve its environment and set PWD properly.

## [2.2.3] - 2024-04-27
### Fixed
- Highligher and hinter work now, since it was regressed from the previous minor release.
- `cat` command no longer prints extra newline at end of each file

### Added
- `cat` command now reads files in chunks, allowing for reading large files

## [2.2.2] - 2024-04-16
### Fixed
- Line refresh fixes (less flicker)
- Do more checks for a TTY
  - Panic if ENOTTY is thrown from readline
  - use `x/term` function to check if a terminal

### Added
- Page Up/Down keybinds for Greenhouse will now scroll up and down the size of the region (a page)

### Changed
- Remove usage of `hilbish.goro` in Greenhouse.
- Values in `hilbish` table are no longer protected. This means
they can be overridden. (#287)

## [2.2.1] - 2023-12-26
### Fixed
- Removed a left over debug print
- Recover panic in `hilbish.goro`

## [2.2.0] - 2023-12-25
### Added
- [Native Modules](https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/docs/api/hilbish/hilbish.module/)
- Made a few additions to the sink type:
  - `read()` method for retrieving input (so now the `in` sink of commanders is useful)
  - `flush()` and `autoFlush()` related to flushing outputs
  - `pipe` property to check if a sink with input is a pipe (like stdin)
- Add fuzzy search to history search (enable via `hilbish.opts.fuzzy = true`)
- Show indexes on cdr list and use ~ for home directory.

- `hilbish.messages` interface (details in [#219])
- `hilbish.notification` signal when a message/notification is sent
- `notifyJobFinish` opt to send a notification when background jobs are
- `hilbish.goVersion` for the version of Go used to compile Hilbish.
completed.
- Allow numbered arg substitutions in aliases.
  - Example: `hilbish.alias('hello', 'echo %1 says hello')` allows the user to run `hello hilbish`
  which will output `hilbish says hello`.
- Greenhouse
  - Greenhouse is a pager library and program. Basic usage is `greenhouse <file>`
  - Using this also brings enhancements to the `doc` command like easy
  navigation of neighboring doc files.
  Ctrl-N can be used for the table of contents, which views adjacent documentation.

### Changed

- Local docs is used if one of Hilbish's branches is found
- Return 1 exit code on doc not found
- `hilbish.runner.getCurrent()` to get the current runner
- Initialize Hilbish Lua API before handling signals

### Fixed

## [2.0.0] - 2022-12-20
**NOTES FOR USERS/PACKAGERS UPDATING:**
- Hilbish now uses [Task] insead of Make for builds.
- The doc format has been changed from plain text to markdown.
**YOU MUST reinstall Hilbish to remove the duplicate, old docs.**
- Hilbish will by default install to **`/usr/local`** instead of just `/usr/`
when building via Task. This is mainly to avoid conflict of distro packages
and local installs, and is the correct place when building from git either way.
To keep Hilbish in `/usr`, you must have `PREFIX="/usr/"` when running `task build` or `task install`
- Windows is no longer supported. It will build and run, but **will** have problems.
If you want to help fix the situation, start a discussion or open an issue and contribute.

[Task]: https://taskfile.dev/#/

### Added
- Inline hints, akin to fish and the others.
To make a handler for hint text, you can set the `hilbish.hinter` function.
For more info, look at its docs with the `doc hilbish` command.
- Syntax highlighting function. To make a handler for it, set
`hilbish.highlighter`. Same thing as the hinter, check `doc hilbish` for
more info/docs.
- Ctrl+K deletes from the cursor to the end of the line. ([#128](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/128))
- Alt+Backspace as an alternative of Ctrl+W to delete a word. ([#132](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/132))
- Enhanced timer API (`doc timers`)
- Don't exit until intervals are stopped/finished when running a non interactive script.
- Ctrl+D deletes character below cursor if line isn't empty instead of exiting.
- Ctrl+Delete to forward delete a word.
- Right prompt ([#140](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/140))
- Ctrl+_ to undo in Emacs input mode.
- Emacs style forward/backward word keybinds ([#139](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/139))
- `hilbish.completion.call` to call a completion handler (`doc completions`)
- `hilbish.completion.handler` to set a custom handler for completions. This
is for everything/anything as opposed to just adding a single command completion. 
[#122](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/issues/122)
- `fs.abs(path)` to get absolute path.
- Nature module (`doc nature`)
- `hilbish.jobs.add(cmdstr, args, execPath)` to add a job to the job table.
`cmdstr` would be user input, `args` is the args for the command (includes arg0)
and `execPath` is absolute path to command executable
- `job.add` hook is thrown when a job is added. acts as a unique hook for
jobs
- `hilbish.jobs.disown(id)` and `disown` builtin to disown a job. `disown`
without arguments will disown the last job.
- `hilbish.jobs.last()` returns the last added job.
- Job output (stdout/stderr) can now be obtained via the `stdout` and `stderr`
fields on a job object.
- Documentation for jobs is now available via `doc jobs`.
- `hilbish.alias.resolve(cmdstr)` to resolve a command alias.
- `hilbish.opts` for shell options.
- `hilbish.editor` interface for interacting with the line editor that
Hilbish uses.
- `hilbish.vim` interface to dynamically get/set vim registers.
Example usage: `hilbish.vim.registers['a'] = 'hello'`. You can also
get the mode with it via `hilbish.vim.mode`
- `hilbish.version` interface for more info about Hilbish's version. This
includes git commit, branch, and (new!!) release name.
- Added `fg` and `bg` builtins
- `job.foreground()` and `job.background()`, when `job` is a job object,
foreground and backgrounds a job respectively.
- Friendlier functions to the `hilbish.runner` interface, which also allow
having and using multiple runners.
- A few new functions to the `fs` module:
  - `fs.basename(path)` gets the basename of path
  - `fs.dir(path)` gets the directory part of path
  - `fs.glob(pattern)` globs files and directories based on patterns
  - `fs.join(dirs...)` joins directories by OS dir separator
- .. and 2 properties
  - `fs.pathSep` is the separator for filesystem paths and directories
  - `fs.pathListSep` is the separator for $PATH env entries
- Lua modules located in `hilbish.userDir.data .. '/hilbish/start'` (like `~/.local/share/hilbish/start/foo/init.lua`)
will be ran on startup
- `hilbish.init` hook, thrown after Hilbish has initialized Lua side
- Message of the day on startup (`hilbish.motd`), mainly intended as quick
small news pieces for releases. It is printed by default. To disable it,
set `hilbish.opts.motd` to false.
- `history` opt has been added and is true by default. Setting it to false
disables commands being added to history.
- `hilbish.rawInput` hook for input from the readline library
- Completion of files in quotes
- A new and "safer" event emitter has been added. This causes a performance deficit, but avoids a lot of
random errors introduced with the new Lua runtime (see [#197])
- `bait.release(name, catcher)` removes `handler` for the named `event`
- `exec`, `clear` and `cat` builtin commands
- `hilbish.cancel` hook thrown when user cancels input with Ctrl-C
- 1st item on history is now inserted when history search menu is opened ([#148])
- Documentation has been improved vastly!

### Changed
- **Breaking Change:** Upgraded to Lua 5.4.
This is probably one of (if not the) biggest things in this release.
To recap quickly on what matters (mostly):
  - `os.execute` returns 3 values instead of 1 (but you should be using `hilbish.run`)
  - I/O operations must be flushed (`io.flush()`)
- **Breaking Change:** MacOS config paths now match Linux.
- Overrides on the `hilbish` table are no longer permitted.
- **Breaking Change:** Runner functions are now required to return a table.
It can (at the moment) have 4 variables:
  - `input` (user input)
  - `exitCode` (exit code)
  - `error` (error message)
  - `continue` (whether to prompt for more input)
User input has been added to the return to account for runners wanting to
prompt for continued input, and to add it properly to history. `continue`
got added so that it would be easier for runners to get continued input
without having to actually handle it at all.  
- **Breaking Change:** Job objects and timers are now Lua userdata instead
of a table, so their functions require you to call them with a colon instead
of a dot. (ie. `job.stop()` -> `job:stop()`)
- All `fs` module functions which take paths now implicitly expand ~ to home.
- **Breaking Change:** `hilbish.greeting` has been moved to an opt (`hilbish.opts.greeting`) and is
always printed by default. To disable it, set the opt to false.
- **Breaking Change:** `command.no-perm` hook has been replaced with `command.not-executable`
- History is now fetched from Lua, which means users can override `hilbish.history`
methods to make it act how they want.
- `guide` has been removed. See the [website](https://rosettea.github.io/Hilbish/)
for general tips and documentation

### Fixed
- If in Vim replace mode, input at the end of the line inserts instead of
replacing the last character.
- Make forward delete work how its supposed to.
- Prompt refresh not working properly.
- Crashing on input in xterm. ([#131](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/131))
- Make delete key work on st ([#131](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/131))
- `hilbish.login` being the wrong value.
- Put full input in history if prompted for continued input
- Don't put alias expanded command in history (sound familiar?)
- Handle cases of stdin being nonblocking (in the case of [#136](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/issues/136))
- Don't prompt for continued input if non interactive
- Don't insert unhandled control keys.
- Handle sh syntax error in alias
- Use invert for completion menu selection highlight instead of specific
colors. Brings an improvement on light themes, or themes that don't follow
certain color rules.
- Home/End keys now go to the actual start/end of the input.
- Input getting cut off on enter in certain cases.
- Go to the next line properly if input reaches end of terminal width.
- Cursor position with CJK characters has been corrected ([#145](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/145))
- Files with same name as parent folder in completions getting cut off [#130](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/issues/130))
- `hilbish.which` now works with commanders and aliases.
- Background jobs no longer take stdin so they do not interfere with shell
input.
- Full name of completion entry is used instead of being cut off
- Completions are fixed in cases where the query/line is an alias alone
where it can also resolve to the beginning of command names.
(reference [this commit](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/commit/2790982ad123115c6ddbc5764677fdca27668cea))
for explanation.
- Jobs now throw `job.done` and set running to false when stopped via
Lua `job.stop` function.
- Jobs are always started in sh exec handler now instead of only successful start.
- SIGTERM is handled properly now, which means stopping jobs and timers.
- Fix panic on trailing newline on pasted multiline text.
- Completions will no longer be refreshed if the prompt refreshes while the
menu is open.
- Print error on search fail instead of panicking
- Windows related fixes:
  - `hilbish.dataDir` now has tilde (`~`) expanded.
  - Arrow keys now work on Windows terminals.
  - Escape codes now work.
- Escape percentage symbols in completion entries, so you will no longer see
an error of missing format variable
- Fix an error with sh syntax in aliases
- Prompt now works with east asian characters (CJK)
- Set back the prompt to normal after exiting the continue prompt with ctrl-d
- Take into account newline in input when calculating input width. Prevents
extra reprinting of the prompt, but input with newlines inserted is still a problem
- Put cursor at the end of input when exiting $EDITOR with Vim mode bind
- Calculate width of virtual input properly (completion candidates)
- Users can now tab complete files with spaces while quoted or with escaped spaces.
This means a query of `Files\ to\ ` with file names of `Files to tab complete` and `Files to complete`
will result in the files being completed.
- Fixed grid menu display if cell width ends up being the width of the terminal
- Cut off item names in grid menu if its longer than cell width
- Fix completion search menu disappearing
- Make binary completion work with bins that have spaces in the name
- Completion paths having duplicated characters if it's escaped
- Get custom completion command properly to call from Lua
- Put proper command on the line when using up and down arrow keys to go through command history
- Don't do anything if length of input rune slice is 0 ([commit for explanation](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/commit/8d40179a73fe5942707cd43f9c0463dee53eedd8))

- `index` subdoc will no longer appear
- Alias expansion with quotes
- Add full command to history in the case of incomplete input
- `hilbish.exec()` now has a windows substitute
- Fixed case of successful command after prompted for more input not writing to history
- `command.exit` is thrown when sh input is incorrect and when command executed after continue
prompt exits successfully

### Changed
- The minimal config is truly minimal now
- Default config is no longer copied to user's config and is instead ran its location
#### Breaking Changes
(there were a lot...)
- Change default SHLVL to 0 instead of 1
- ~/.hilbishrc.lua will no longer be run by default, it now
only uses the paths mentioned below.
- Changed Hilbish's config path to something more suited
according to the OS (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hilbish/init.lua` on Linux,
`~/Library/Application Support/hilbish/init.lua` on MacOS and
(`%APPDATA%/hilbish/init.lua` on Windows). Previously on Unix-like it was
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hilbish/hilbishrc.lua`
- The history path has been changed to a better suited path.
On Linux, it is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/hilbish/.hilbish-history` and for others it is
the config path.
- `hilbish.xdg` no longer exists, use `hilbish.userDir` instead,
as it functions the same but is OS agnostic
- `hilbish.flag()` has been removed
- `~/.hprofile.lua` has been removed, instead check in your config if `hilbish.login`
is true
- `hilbish.complete()` has had a slight refactor to fit with the new readline library.
It now expects a table of "completion groups" which are just tables with the
`type` and `items` keys. Here is a (more or less) complete example of how it works now:
	```lua
	hilbish.complete('command.git', function()
		return {
			{
				items = {
					'add',
					'clone'
				},
				type = 'grid'
			},
			{
				items = {
					['--git-dir'] = {'Description of flag'},
					'-c'
				},
				type = 'list'
			}
		}
	end)
	```
	Completer functions are now also expected to handle subcommands/subcompletions

## [0.7.1] - 2021-11-22
### Fixed
- Tab complete absolute paths to binaries properly
- Allow execution of absolute paths to binaries (https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/commit/06272778f85dad04e0e7abffc78a5b9b0cebd067 regression)

## [0.7.0] - 2021-11-22
### Added
- `hilbish.interactive` and `hilbish.login` properties to figure out if Hilbish is interactive or a login shell, respectively.
- `hilbish.read` function to take input more elegantly than Lua's `io.read`
- Tab Completion Enhancements
  - A new tab complete API has been added. It is the single `complete` function which takes a "scope" (example: `command.<cmdname>`) and a callback which is
  expected to return a table. Users can now add custom completions for specific commands.
  An example is:
  ```lua
  complete('command.git', function()
	return {
		'add',
		'version',
		commit = {
			'--message',
			'--verbose',
			'<file>'
		}
	}
  end)
  ```
  For `git`, Hilbish will complete commands add, version and commit. For the commit subcommand, it will complete the flags and/or files which `<file>` is used to represent.
  - Hilbish will now complete binaries in $PATH, or any executable to a path (like `./` or `../`)
  - Files with spaces will be automatically put in quotes and completions will work for them now.
- `prependPath` function (#81)
- Signal hooks (#80)
  - This allows scripts to add their own way of handling terminal resizes (if you'd need that) or Ctrl-C
- Module properties (like `hilbish.ver`) are documented with the `doc` command.
- Document bait hooks

### Fixed
- The prompt won't come up on terminal resize anymore.
- `appendPath` should work properly on Windows.
- A panic when a commander has an error has been fixed.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-10-21
### Fixed
- Require paths now use the `dataDir` variable so there is no need to change it anymore unless you want to add more paths
- Remove double slash in XDG data require paths
- Ctrl+C is handled properly when not interactive and won't result in a panic anymore
- Commanders are handled by the sh interpreter library only now, so they work with sh syntax

### Changed
- Error messages from `fs` functions now include the path provided

## [0.6.0] - 2021-10-17
### Added
- Hilbish will expand `~` in the preloadPath and samplePathConf variables. These are for compile time.
- On Windows, the hostname in `%u` has been removed.
- Made it easier to compile on Windows by adding Windows-tailored vars and paths.
- Add require paths `./libs/?/?.lua`
- Hilbish will now respect $XDG_CONFIG_HOME and will load its config and history there first and use Lua libraries in there and $XDG_DATA_HOME if they are set. (#71)
  - If not, Hilbish will still default to `~`
- Added some new hooks
  - `command.precmd` is thrown right before Hilbish prompts for input
  - `command.preexec` is thrown right before Hilbish executes a command. It passes 2 arguments: the command as the user typed, and what Hilbish will actually execute (resolved alias)
- `hilbish.dataDir` is now available to know the directory of Hilbish data files (default config, docs, preload, etc)
- A `docgen` program has been added to `cmd/docgen` in the GitHub repository, As the name suggests, it will output docs in a `docs` folder for functions implemented in Go
- All hilbish modules/libraries now have a `__doc` metatable entry which is simply a short description of the module.
- `fs.readdir(dir)` has been added. It will return a table of files in `dir`
- Errors in the `fs.mkdir` function are now handled.
- **Breaking Change:** `fs.cd` no longer returns a numeric code to indicate error. Instead, it returns an error message.
- The `doc` command has been added to document functions of Hilbish libraries. Run the command for more details.
- `link(url, text)` has been added to `ansikit`. It returns a string which can be printed to produce a hyperlink in a terminal. Note that not all terminals support this feature.
- The [Succulent](https://github.com/Rosettea/Succulent) library has been added. This includes more utility functions and expansions to the Lua standard library itself.
- The command string is now passed to the `command.exit` hook

### Changed
- Hilbish won't print an extra newline at exit with ctrl + d
- `command.exit` with 0 exit code will now be thrown if input is nothing
- **Breaking Change:** `fs.stat` has been made better. It returns a proper table instead of userdata, and has fields instead of functions
  - It includes `name`, `mode` as a octal representation in a string, `isDir`, and `size`

### Fixed
- `timeout()` is now blocking
- Directories with spaces in them can now be `cd`'d to
- An alias with the same name as the command will now not cause a freeze (#73)
- Userdata is no longer returned in the following cases:
  - Commander arguments
  - `fs` functions

## [0.5.1] - 2021-06-16

### Added

- Add `~/.config/hilbish` as a require path

### Changed

- `cd` hook is only thrown after directory has actually changed

### Fixed

- Handle error in commander properly, preventing a panic from Lua

## [0.5.0] - 2021-06-12

An absolutely massive release. Probably the biggest yet, includes a bunch of fixes and new features and convenient additions to the Lua API.

### Added

- `-n` flag, which checks Lua for syntax errors without running it
- `exec(command)` function, acts like the `exec` builtin in sh
    - Example: `exec 'awesome'` in an .xinitrc file with Hilbish as shebang
- Commands from commander can now `return` an exit code
```lua
commander.register('false', function()
return 1
end)
```
When `false` is run, it will have the exit code of `1`, this is shorter/easier than throwing the command.exit hook and can work if the functionality of that changes
- Added `-c` description
- `args` variable, set when Hilbish runs a Lua script. It is an array that includes the execute path as the first argument
- Lua code can be aliased
- Recursive aliases
    - At the moment this only works for the first argument
- Hilbish can now be used with Hilbiline if compiled to do so (currently only for testing purposes)
- `goro(func)` runs a `func`tion in a goroutine. With channels that gopher-lua also provides, one can do parallelism and concurrency in Lua (but go style).
    - `coroutine` no those dont exist they dont matter `goro` is easier
- `cd -` will change to the previous directory
- `hilbish.cwd()` gets the current working directory
- `timeout(func, time)` works exactly like the `setTimeout` function in JavaScript. It will run `func` after a period of `time` in milliseconds.
- `interval(func, time)` works exactly like the `setInterval` function in JavaScripit. It will run `func` every `time` milliseconds
- `hilbish.home` is a crossplatform Lua alternative to get the home directory easily.
- `commander.deregister(cmdName)` de-registers any command defined with commander.

### Changed

- **Breaking Change**: Move `_user` and `_ver` to a global `hilbish` table
    - Accessing username and Hilbish version is now done with `hilbish.user` and `hilbish.ver`
- `hilbish.run(cmd)` runs cmd with Hilbish's sh interpreter. Using this function instead of `os.execute` ensures that sh syntax works everywhere Hilbish does.
- `hilbish.flag(flag)` checks if flag has been passed to Hilbish.
- Aliases now work with every command and not only the first one
    - Therefore `alias1; alias2` works now
- `command.not-found` hook
- `$SHLVL` is now incremented in Hilbish. If not a valid number, it will be changed to 1
- `fs.mkdir` can now make directories recursively if the 2nd argument is set to `true`
    - `fs.mkdir('path/to/dir', true)`
- Hilbish runs a `preload.lua` file in the current directory first, then falls back to the global preload. Before the order was reversed.
- Check if aliased command is defined in Lua, so registered `commander`s can be aliased
- Add input to history before alias expansion. Basically, this adds the actual alias to history instead of the aliased command.
- Global preload path, require paths, default config directory and sample config directory can now be changed at compile time to help support other systems.

### Fixed

- `cd` now exits with code `1` instead of the error code if it occurs
- Don't append directory to $PATH with `appendPath` if its already there
- Continued input is no longer joined with a space unless explicitly wanted
- Hilbish won't try to go interactive if it isn't launched in a TTY (terminal)
- Ctrl+D on a continue prompt with no input no longer causes a panic
- Actually handle the `-h`/`--help` option

## [0.4.0] - 2021-05-01

### Added
- Ctrl C in the prompt now cancels/clear input (I've needed this for so long also)
- Made Hilbish act like a login shell on login
    - If Hilbish is the login shell, or the `-l`/`--login` flags are used, Hilbish will use an additional `~/.hprofile.lua` file, you can use this to set environment variables once on login
- `-c` has been added to run a single command (this works exactly like being in the prompt would, so Lua works as well)
- `-i` (also `--interactive`) has been added to force Hilbish to be an interactive shell in cases where it usually wont be (like with `-c`)
- Use readline in continue prompt
- Added a `mulitline` hook that's thrown when in the continue/multiline prompt
- Added `appendPath` function to append a directory to `$PATH`
    - `~` will be expanded to `$HOME` as well
- A utility `string.split` function is now added
    - `string.split(str, delimiter)`
- Added a `_user` variable to easily get current user's name

### Changed

- **BREAKING Change**: [Lunacolors](https://github.com/Hilbis/Lunacolors) has replaced ansikit for formatting colors, which means the format function has been removed from ansikit and moved to Lunacolors.
    - Users must replace ansikit with `lunacolors` in their config files
- A getopt-like library is now used for command line flag parsing
- `cd` builtin now supports using environment variables
    - This means you can now `cd $NVM_DIR` as an example
- Function arguments are now more strictly typed (`prompt(nil)` wouldnt work now)
- Other general code/style changes

## Fixed

- Fix makefile adding Hilbish to `/etc/shells` on every `make install`

Since Lunacolors is a submodule, you may just want to completely reclone Hilbish recursively and then update (rerun `make install`)
Or instead of recloning, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` in Hilbish's git directory

## [0.3.2] - 2021-04-10

### Added

- Add more functions to `ansikit` module
- Add functions `stat` and `mkdir` to `fs` module
- `-C` flag to define path to config
- Add require path `~/.local/share/hilbish/libs`

### Changed

- Continue to new line if output doesnt end with it

Observed:

## [0.3.1] - 2021-04-06

### Fixed

- Fix `%u` in prompt format being full name and instead make it actually username

## [0.3.0] - 2021-04-05

### Added

- Added a `multiprompt` function to change the prompt of the multiline/continuation/newline prompt
- `_ver` variable to get Hilbish's version from Lua

### Changed

- **BREAKING Change**: Removed Bait hooks `command.success` and `command.fail`, there is now the single hook `command.exit`, with a single argument passed which the exit code of the command. Use this to determine if a command has failed or not (failure is code != 0)
- **BREAKING Change**: The Ansikit function `text` has been renamed to `format`.
- `fs.cd` now throws an exception instead of silently failing, which you should handle with `pcall`
- Enhancements to the `cd` command:
    - With no arguments will move to $HOME
    - Now throws a cd hook, with a single hook arg being the arguments to the command
    - Now works for directories with spaces
- Lua input now throws a success hook if it succeeded
- Command history is now saved to `~/.hilbish-history`
- Globals defined in Lua that are strings will be defined as an env variable ([#16](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish/pull/16))
- Input ending with `\` will now go to a newline
- `exit` command is now written in Lua

### Fixed

- Input is now trimmed
- Internals are slightly cleaned up and codebase split up
- Hilbish will now fall back to a builtin minimal config if the user's config has syntax errors on loading
- Commands defined in Lua now report the error to the user cleanly instead of panicking if it has occured

## [0.2.0] - 2021-03-31

### Added

- Hooks (events) are the new and main thing in v0.2, you can now listen for hooks or cast out (emit) custom ones, via the [bait](https://github.com/Hilbis/Hilbish/wiki/Bait) package
- `^^` to refer to the previous command. It's for the lazy hands like me, so I can do something like `ENV=VAR ^^`
- Way more (more like any) comments in the core code.

### Changed

- Prompt has been changed to have printf-like verbs to format. This makes it easier on the user's side to configure, and doesn't require hooks to change it for things like current directory.
- Default prompt's changed and the triangle changes color based on if command failed or not.

## [0.1.2] - 2021-03-24

### Added

- Add Lua input to history

## [0.1.1] - 2021-03-24

### Added

- Go to new line if sh input is incomplete

```bash
> for i in {1..5}
```

This input for example will prompt for more input to complete:

![input](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/b757e474da5880d57be135087f59f45ab214b8f39f182b299d861cac7b6d84ff/68747470733a2f2f6d6f646575732e69732d696e736964652e6d652f30624456547461352e706e67)

## [0.1.0] - 2021-03-24

### Added

- Tab complete files
- Makefile installation
- sh support

## [0.0.12] - 2021-03-21
