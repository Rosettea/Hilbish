Completions for commands can be created with the [`hilbish.complete`](../api/hilbish#complete)
function. See the link for how to use it.

To create completions for a command is simple.
The callback will be passed 3 parameters:
- `query` (string): The text that the user is currently trying to complete.
This should be used to match entries.
- `ctx` (string): Contains the entire line. Use this if
more text is needed to be parsed for context.
- `fields` (string): The `ctx` split up by spaces.

In most cases, the completer just uses `fields` to check the amount
and `query` on what to match entries on.

In order to return your results, it has to go within a "completion group."
Then you return a table of completion groups and a prefix. The prefix will
usually just be the `query`.

Hilbish allows one to mix completion menus of different types, so
a grid menu and a list menu can be used and complete and display at the same time.
A completion group is a table with these keys:
- `type` (string): type of completion menu, either `grid` or `list`.
- `items` (table): a list of items. 

The requirements of the `items` table is different based on the
`type`. If it is a `grid`, it can simply be a table of strings.

Otherwise if it is a `list` then each entry can
either be a string or a table.
Example:
```lua
local cg = {
	items = {
		'list item 1',
		['--command-flag-here'] = {'this does a thing', '--the-flag-alias'}
	},
	type = 'list'
}
local cg2 = {
	items = {'just', 'a bunch', 'of items', 'here', 'hehe'},
	type = 'grid'
}

return {cg, cg2}, prefix
```

Which looks like this:

# Completion Group Types
### grid
Grid is the simplest completion group type. All items are strings and when
completion is done is displayed in a grid based on size.

Example:
```lua
{
	items = {'just', 'a bunch', 'of items', 'here', 'hehe'},
	type = 'grid'
}
```

### list
The list completion group type displays in a list. A list item can either be a string, or a table for additional display options.
A completion alias can be specified either as the `2nd` entry in the options table
or te `alias` key.

A description can optionally be displayed for a list item, which is either the `1st`
entry or the `description` key.

Lastly, list entries can be styled. This is done with the `display` key. If this is present, this
overrides what the completion item *looks* like.

Example:
```lua
{
	items = {
		['--flag'] = {
			description = 'this flag nukes the bri ish',
			alias = '--bye-bri-ish',
			display = lunacolors.format('--{blue}fl{red}ag')
		},
		['--flag2'] = {
			'make pizza', -- description
			'--pizzuh', -- alias
			display = lunacolors.yellow '--pizzuh'
		},
		'--flag3'
	},
	type = 'list'
}
```

# Completion Handler
Like most parts of Hilbish, it's made to be extensible and
customizable. The default handler for completions in general can
be overwritten to provide more advanced completions if needed.
This usually doesn't need to be done though, unless you know
what you're doing.

The default completion handler provides 3 things:
binaries (with a plain name requested to complete, those in
$PATH), files, or command completions. It will try to run a handler
for the  command or fallback to file completions.

To overwrite it, just assign a function to `hilbish.completion.handler` like so:
```lua
-- line is the entire line as a string
-- pos is the position of the cursor.
function hilbish.completion.handler(line, pos)
	-- do things
end
```
